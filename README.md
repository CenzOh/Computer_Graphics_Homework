# Computer_Graphics_Homework_1
First homework in my Computer Graphics class Fall 2021. We made drawings with color interpolation, masks, menus, and drew a village of houses. We created the programs with C++ and utilized OpenGL and GLUT

## Problem 1 Part 1
Design a drawing including two geometric figures with solid colors, 2 figures with color interpolation (more than one color), and 3 filled with given masks

For the masks, we utilized the campfire, fly, and brick masks
